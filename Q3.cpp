/*
Errors:
1) No error in the createString() function because string literals have static storage duration.

2)Error in the createInt() function:
  The function returns a pointer to a local variable, which leads to undefined behavior when dereferenced.

  createInt() defines a local variable x with the value 100, then returns a pointer to x.

  The variable x is local to the createInt() function, and once the function returns, the memory for x is
  deallocated. The returned pointer &x now points to a location in memory that is no longer valid.

  Undefined behavior: Dereferencing *ip (trying to access the value) may result in garbage or a runtime error,
  depending on the compiler and environment. It might not always crash, but it will give unpredictable results.

  Fix: To avoid this issue, We should either:
  Return a pointer to dynamically allocated memory (new or malloc), or
  Return the variable by value instead of by pointer.

Corrected createInt() function:

int createInt(){
    int x = 100;
    return x;  // Return by value instead of returning a pointer to a local variable
}
